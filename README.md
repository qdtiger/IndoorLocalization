## 1. Introduction

**Indoor localization** is becoming critical to empower various indoor location-based services (LBSs).  Although many measurements (e.g. TOA, TDOA, AOA, and RSS) and communication networks (e.g. WLAN, GSM, ZigBee, and Bluetooth) could be exploited in indoor scenarios, each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages, which brings challenges for design of practical localization systems.

Here we list some materials that explain the fundamentals of localization systems.
